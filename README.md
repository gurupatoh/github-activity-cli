# GitHub Activity CLI

---

## Features

- Display events like commits, issues, stars, and more.
- Easy-to-use CLI interface with descriptive commands.
- Handles errors gracefully (e.g., invalid usernames or API failures).

---

## Requirements

- Go 1.20 or later installed.
- Internet connection to fetch data from the GitHub API.
